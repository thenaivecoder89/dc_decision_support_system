# dc_decision_support_system
A rule-based decision support system that uses the mistral:7b-instruct-q5_K_M model to generate recommendation reports for DC assessors.
This repository contains a full-stack application designed to assist evaluators in assessing the **Global Expansion Strategy** of organizations based on both **quantitative metrics** and **qualitative documentation**. The system integrates rule-based logic, local LLM inference, and a PostgreSQL database, all wrapped in a modern, intuitive UI.
